Web alert is a crawler to downloading site source and searching content changes

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install :

## What can I do?
Type a site addres and content name e.g class name, id name or raw string; accept a proper markup and start observe it

## Future
In future I want to add various features to this app. Searching all possibilites and combinations typed text. Not rarely markup has a strange name. I'm planning to handle it.
